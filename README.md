# 2023_FALL_CAD_LAB3
Lab3 of course: Special Topics in Computer Aided Design in National Yang Ming Chiao Tung Univerity.

The lab's goal is to implement and perform static timing analysis and power analysis of a given circuit netlist and given library file.

312510155.cpp is the core C++ file, which takes netlist files (.v), pattern files (.pat), and library files (.lib) as input.

I achieved 1st place among 100+ students in the course in all small and large hidden cases, distinguished by algorithms and data structures resulting in reduced latency.

For more details, please refer to HW3_spec.pdf.
